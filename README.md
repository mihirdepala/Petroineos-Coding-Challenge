# Petroineos-Coding-Challenge

Description:
This code is a Python script for updating and managing a database of symbols. It allows users to load new symbol data from CSV files, process and add metadata to the data, save it to a database file, and fetch the most recent data from the database.

*How to Use*:

*Dependencies*:

Python 3.x
pandas library

*Setup*:

Download the code file (symbols_update.py) and place it in your working directory.
Ensure you have the necessary CSV files (symbols_update_1.csv, symbols_update_2.csv, symbols_update_3.csv) containing the new symbol data.

*Usage*:

Run the script in a Python environment.
The script will automatically load each CSV file, update the database with the new data, and print the most recent data from the database.

*Customization*:

You can modify the input file paths or database file name in the script according to your requirements.
